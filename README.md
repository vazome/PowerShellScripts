### [LogToolkit](/Up%20To%20Date/Text%20Sort/LogToolkit.ps1)
LogToolkit is a tool written in PowerShell for internal usage. 
The main concept is to give a robot handle something that shouldn’t be done by a human and/or where current tools are struggling at something.
The tool has features such as:
- Search - common search in huge sized logs
- Get values and X - get’s values and does something them
- Convert to SQL - converts set of values to SQL format
- Differentiation -  compares 2 files (For today compares only .CSVs)
